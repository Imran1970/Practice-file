    <p>Pollution is a significant threat to our environment and is caused by the reckless attitude of man towards nature. Our Earth provides us with food and shelter, whereas we treat it mercilessly and plunder its resources. Pollution is a direct result of our greed. We dump waste into our water bodies without caring for the organisms living in them. The balance of various gases in the atmosphere has been disrupted because of the large number of vehicles plying on the road. Even factories that release harmful gases into the atmosphere contribute to air pollution. When we do excessive and uncontrolled farming on a piece of land, it loses its natural minerals. So, when we use fertilizers to boost their productivity, it pollutes the soil. Noise pollution is caused by factories, jets, airplanes, etc. It harms our ears and can impair hearing.</p>
