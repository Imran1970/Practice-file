    <h2>Microsoft Word (All versions) has a hidden feature that allows you to insert Lorem Ipsum or Random text into your document easily. I actually use the feature all the Word 2007, 2010, and the latest Word 2013 has a feature that allows you to create Random text or Lorem Ipsum text quickly and easily using a simple command. It’s very convenient for bloggers who need to create a mock website with dummy text or create a mockup of something for a PowerPoint presentation.</h2>
